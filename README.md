OverSite was our final cross pollination project at [Turing School of Software and Design](http://turing.io). The goal for this project was to build a full stack application from ideation to production in just 14 days. The emphasis was on creating a professional agile workflow with a combination of front-end and back-end developers.


**Challenges:**

The main challenge of this project was connecting a front-end and back-end into a working deployed production application while implementing continuous integration with testing. On the back-end, challenges included building a REST API using an entirely new language and framework. On the front-end using Cypress with CI was a challenge that we hope to continue working on in future iterations.  

## Setup
1. Clone down this repo and [back-end repo](https://github.com/SMJ289/oversite-be), follow directions on back-end repo readme for setup instructions.   
2. `cd` into the new directory
